# Predict_Patient_Acuity
We build a simple random forests model using the anonymized_data.csv data set for predicting an expected CPT Evaluation and Management score for new data. This project is organized as follows: (a) data proprocessing and variable selection; (b) basic regression model; (c) hyper-parameters tuning; and (d) techniques for dimensionality reduction.
